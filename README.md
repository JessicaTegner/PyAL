About PyAL
==========
PyAL is a wrapper around the OpenAL library and as such similar to the
discontinued PyOpenAL project. In contrast to PyOpenAL, it has no
licensing restrictions, nor does it rely on C code, but uses ctypes
instead.

Installation
============
PyAL is easy to install and integrate within your own projects. Just
follow Python's standard procedure of installing packages or look for a
prebuilt package for your operating system or distribution.

Documentation
=============
If you just started with OpenAL and PyAL, it is strongly recommended
that you read through the *advanced sound support* section of the documentation
to understand, how OpenAL works in general. In any case, you can find the
documentation at *doc/html* or online at http://pythonhosted.org/PyAL (for the
current stable release) or at http://pyal.readthedocs.org (for the current
development release).

License
=======
This library is given to the public domain. There are no licensing
restrictions. Please see *doc/copying.rst* for further details.
