About PyAL
==========
PyAL is a wrapper around the OpenAL library and as such similar to the
discontinued PyOpenAL project. In contrast to PyOpenAL, it has no
licensing restrictions, nor does it rely on C code, but uses ctypes
instead.

Installation
============
For right now, you can only install from the source tree.
* git clone https://github.com/NicklasMCHD/PyAL.git
* cd PyAl
* python setup.py install

Documentation
=============
If you just started with OpenAL and PyAL, it is strongly recommended
that you read through the *advanced sound support* section of the documentation
to understand, how OpenAL works in general. In any case, you can find the
documentation at *doc/html* or online at http://pythonhosted.org/PyAL (for the
current stable release) or at http://pyal.readthedocs.org (for the current
development release).

License
=======
This library is given to the public domain. There are no licensing
restrictions. Please see *doc/copying.rst* for further details, if you need it.
